![](img/covid19_screenshot.png)


Covid-19 connector imports covid-data into data studio from covid19api.com. It provides information how many cases (Active,Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths) were registered from around 250 locations. 
    
Connector is based on a free plan ofÂ covid19api which has limitations. 
  
Some locations have no data (i.e.Niue). One country: USA has a response which can't be fetched properly based on a free plan.
